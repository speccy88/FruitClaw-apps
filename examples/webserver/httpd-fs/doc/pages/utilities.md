# Installed Utilities

This page lists the user-facing utilities compiled into the Fruit Jam
`esp-hosted` production release. The live board is still the source of truth:
run `help` from NSH and `fruitclaw tools` for the current command and MCP tool
surface.

```

## Network Utilities

Compiled network/user-space utilities include:

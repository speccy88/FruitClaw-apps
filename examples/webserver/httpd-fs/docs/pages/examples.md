# Examples

These examples are copy-paste starting points. Replace `DEVICE_IP` with the
board's address from `ifconfig wlan0`.

## First Shell Session

```sh
help
uname -a
ifconfig wlan0
fruitclaw status
fruitclaw tools
```

`help` lists NuttX shell commands and built-in apps. `fruitclaw status` is the
best first health snapshot.

## Web And MCP Smoke Test

```sh
curl http://DEVICE_IP/
curl -i http://DEVICE_IP/mcp \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"ping"}'
```

List tools:

```sh
curl -i http://DEVICE_IP/mcp \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}'
```

Call a safe tool:

```sh
curl -i http://DEVICE_IP/mcp \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"time.now","arguments":{}}}'
```

Get a feature summary:

```sh
curl -i http://DEVICE_IP/mcp \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":4,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"system.info","arguments":{}}}'
```

## Telegram Bring-Up

```sh
fruitclaw telegram-discover
fruitclaw telegram-test
fruitclaw telegram-inject "what time is it? use the time tool"
```

Allowed chat IDs live in:

```text
/data/fruitclaw/telegram_allowed_chats.txt
```

Telegram inbound handling is text-only in this build.

## One-Shot Agent Prompt

```sh
fruitclaw once "what time is it? use the time tool"
```

This exercises the local event queue, router, agent worker, DeepSeek call,
tool call, session logging, and reply path without needing a live Telegram
update.

## NeoPixels

```sh
fruitclaw neopixels blue
fruitclaw neopixels 255 0 0
fruitclaw neopixels rainbow blue 2
fruitclaw neopixels chase green 3
fruitclaw neopixels pulse purple 2
fruitclaw neopixels off
```

MCP tool names:

```text
neopixels.set
neopixels.effect
neopixels.off
```

## DVI And Game Of Life

```sh
dvictrl start
dvictrl info
cgol
```

`cgol` runs Conway's Game of Life on `/dev/fb0` and stays in the foreground.
Press Ctrl-C to stop it.

## Terminal And Devices

Safe terminal examples:

```sh
fruitclaw terminal-run uname -a
fruitclaw terminal-run help
```

Prefer dedicated device tools for `/dev`:

```sh
fruitclaw device list
fruitclaw device read /dev/leds0 16
```

`device.read` and `device.write` are for bounded non-block device paths. They
reject raw SD/media paths such as `/dev/mmcsd0`.

MCP examples:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":5,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"device.list","arguments":{}}}
```

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":6,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"terminal.run","arguments":{"command":"uname -a"}}}
```

## Schedules

```sh
fruitclaw schedule list
fruitclaw schedule add-after reminder 60 "Send a reminder"
fruitclaw schedule add-interval heartbeat 3600 "Run heartbeat"
fruitclaw schedule add-cron morning "0 8 * * *" "Run morning workflow"
fruitclaw schedule add-boot ui "tool:script.run {\"path\":\"generated/ui.be\",\"kind\":\"berry\"}"
fruitclaw schedule remove reminder
```

Plain schedule prompts are delivered directly at fire time. Boot schedules run
once each time FruitClaw starts, which is the intended path for generated LVGL
UIs and maintenance scripts. Prefix the prompt with `agent:` only when the
scheduled job should wake DeepSeek and use tools.

## Berry

Berry scripts are resolved under the active data-root `scripts/` directory.

Example script:

```be
import claw
claw.reply(claw.terminal_run("uname -a"))
```

Run:

```sh
fruitclaw berry-smoke
fruitclaw berry-run example.be '{}'
```

The constrained `claw` module includes `args()`, `reply()`, `tool()`,
`memory_append()`, `terminal_run()`, `neopixels_set()`, `neopixels_off()`,
`neopixels_effect()`, `schedule_add()`, `script_run()`, `rtttl_play()`,
`service_control()`, and `telegram_send()`.

Generated script workflow through MCP:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":7,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"script.write","arguments":{"name":"leds_off","kind":"berry","description":"turn all NeoPixels off","text":"import claw\nclaw.reply(claw.neopixels_off())\n"}}}
```

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":8,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"script.schedule","arguments":{"name":"leds_off","kind":"berry","type":"interval","every_sec":300,"id":"leds-off-every-5m"}}}
```

For a generated LVGL UI, syntax-validate first so validation does not run the
UI loop forever:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":9,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"script.write","arguments":{"name":"hello_ui","kind":"berry","description":"simple LVGL hello screen","validate_mode":"syntax","text":"import lv\nlv.start()\nscr = lv.scr_act()\nlabel = lv.label(scr)\nlabel.set_text(\"FruitClaw ready\")\nlabel.center()\nlv.run()\n"}}}
```

Then run it immediately with `script.run`, or autostart it on every boot:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":10,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"script.schedule","arguments":{"name":"hello_ui","kind":"berry","type":"boot","id":"hello-ui-boot"}}}
```

Use `script.read` to inspect, `script.write` to rework, `script.validate` to
test after edits, `script.run` to execute immediately, and `script.remove` to
delete scripts that are no longer wanted.
